This report will focus on the creation of a language designed for the purpose of creating and manipulating graph-like
structures.

We define a graph like structure as a data type that may contain data ``nodes'' connected by relationships, where a
relationships may contain data on the transition (including the cost, or type of relationship defined).

We also intend to encompass data structures that can be represented in a graph - for example a tree structure constrains
the types of relationships that may form, and thus should be easily represented as a graph.

The questions we will tackle in our implementation are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item What is basic expected functionality of a graph data type?
    \item How can we optimise operations on our graph data type?
\end{itemize}
