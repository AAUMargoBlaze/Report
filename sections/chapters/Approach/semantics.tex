\subsubsection*{Variable declarations}

A variable needs to have been declared before a value can be assigned to it.
It also needs to be declared and have an assigned value if it is used in an expression for a boolean expression, a return statement or a variable assignment.

\subsubsection*{Functions}

A function needs to be defined before being called.
There need to be a return statement accessible for any situation, that means that if the body of the function contains an if-else statement, if there is a return statement in the if block of code, there also needs to be one in an else block of code.
The value in the return statement needs to have the same type as the returned type of the function. %TODO : maybe not a semantic rule but a type rule

\subsubsection*{Graph contexts}

A variable needs to be referenced or cloned in a context before it can be used in relations or other statements in this context, even if it was first declared in this context.
A variable can only be referenced or cloned in a context if it is present (declared, cloned or referenced) in the parent context.

\subsubsection*{Type rules}

The result of an expressions containing floats and integer will be a float.
In a boolean expression, comparing a float and an integer is allowed and the result of \texttt{2.0 == 2} is true
