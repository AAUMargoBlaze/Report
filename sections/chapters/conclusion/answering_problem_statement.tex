At the beginning of the report we laid out several questions to be answered over the course of the project.
This section will reflect on our problem statement questions.

\textbf{What is basic expected functionality of a graph data type?}

During the use cases section we clearly defined the breadth of what our language could be capable of.
As we are very few developers, we have focused on the most basic of functionality - keeping the ability to construct
graphs with nodes, forming relationships between them, and allowing functions to apply to the nodes within the graph.

\textbf{How can we optimise operations on our graph data type?}

The optimisations we have made for the graph data type have been done purely on the python side.
Our approach was to simply build our own Python library capable of applying these optimisations behind the scenes.
