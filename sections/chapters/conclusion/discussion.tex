In the use cases section we outlined what the future of Lattice could be capable of, we feel that there is a good base
implementation that could be leveraged to create more obviously useful applications.
Currently, the visualisation and function mapping features are the standout facets that define our language, allowing
graphs to be built and operated on in a more intuitive form.

With the introduction of the features outlined in the previous section, the case for our language will become stronger,
as the specialisation of a single concept allows us to create more specific operators - which leads to more naturally
``self documenting'' code.
In lieu of these features we have the option of inline python, which can be leveraged to create more obscure algorithms.
