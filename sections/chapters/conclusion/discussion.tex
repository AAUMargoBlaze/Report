A large part of the reflection for software is to perform a cost-benefit analysis of using it from the standpoint of a
potential customer.
In its current MVP state, the difficulty of having to use domain specific software; the lack of features; and the
requirement to learn a new language, all make it hard to justify the usage of our language.
While our language lacks many features, our inclusion of inline Python has proved to be a good decision, as it can
supplement all the shortcomings of our development team size - this leads to the unfortunate inevitable question that
project managers will ask, which is why should they choose our language over direct Python.
In its current state we do not feel as though we can make a strong case for migrations, and would not likely allow it to
be shipped until it is far more fleshed out (preventing early impressions from negatively affecting reputation).

We believe that as features become more mature, and with improvements to accessibility, this outlook would change.
